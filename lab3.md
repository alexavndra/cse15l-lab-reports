## Part 1

### Failure inducing input and code for ArrayExamples.java
```java
import static org.junit.Assert.*;
import org.junit.*;

public class ArrayTests {
    @Test
    public void testReverseInPlace2() {
        int[] input1 = {3, 4, 5, 10, 2};
        ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
        assertArrayEquals(new int[]{2, 10, 5, 4, 3}, input1);
    }
}
```
In this code cell, this is where the bug is provoked.

### Input that doesn't induce a failure
```java
import static org.junit.Assert.*;
import org.junit.*;

public class ArrayTests {
    @Test
	public void testReverseInPlace() {
        int[] input1 = {2};
        ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
        assertArrayEquals(new int[]{2}, input1);
	}
}
```
In this code cell, the bug can't be detected from the input. 

### Symptom with running the tests
![Symptom displayed while running tests](/lab3-assets/symptom.png)
In this test output, there is a bug when running the `testReverseInPlace2()` test, as the expected and output values do not match. </br>

![No symptom displayed while running tests](/lab3-assets/no-symptom.png)
In this output, however, there is no symptoms with running the `testReverseInPlace()` test, since the expected and output values match.

### Finding the bug and resolving the code
#### Code before patching up bug
```java
static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
  }
```

#### Code after patching up bug
```java
static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    int[] copiedArr = new int[arr.length];
    
    // makes sure copiedArr is its own array
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      copiedArr[i] = arr[i];
    }

    // reverses the array by taking the values from copiedArr and updated the original array
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      arr[i] = copiedArr[copiedArr.length - 1 - i];
    }
  }
```
This fix addresses the issue in the code in that it actually updates the original array to be reversed correctly, instead of mis-assigning the "reversed" values to the indices. As shown in the original code, for every int `i` in `arr`, the value of `arr[i]` is now equal to whatever value is at the tail-end of the list; though this will work for arrays with a single element, it will mis-assign values to arrays with multiple elements (e.g. the input given to "evoke" the bug).

In this new code, however, I patched the bug by first creating a new array, `copiedArr`, and filling it with the same values as the given `arr`. Next, to make sure that the original array is reversed, the original array is iterated through, and each of the values from the original array are replaced by `copiedArr`, which is being reversed in the same loop. Since I modified the original array, the `copiedArr` doesn't need to be returned.

I found the `grep -A[num] [word]` command on [gnu.org](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/manual/grep.html#Matching-Control); what this command does is that it outputs all the trailing contexts with the word of the *num* lines. This is useful in that it allows us to see the words (context) surrounding the input we give it.</br>

With `grep -F`, we "obtain patterns" from the given file/directory input ([gnu.org](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/manual/grep.html#Matching-Control)). This is useful since we can see which lines/patterns contain the word we input, especially when looking through a directory, as it also includes the file that the word is located in.

With `grep -c`, we see the number of times a word is mentioned either in a file or a directory [cyberciti.biz](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-use-grep-command-in-linux-unix/). This would be helpful in examining the count of a certain word across all files, tracking their frequency throughout.

For `grep -i`, we see where a word may be in throughout a file or directory, but with the `-i` flag, it ignores any special cases of the given word, just solely printing it out because it matches the contents ([gnu.org](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/manual/grep.html#Matching-Control)). This is useful when we want to see the files and directories that may contain the word, regardless of its case usage (more accurate).
